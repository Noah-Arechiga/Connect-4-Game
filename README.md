Welcome to my Connect 4 program!

How to Play (2 players required):
The goal of the game is to get 4 consecutively tokens in a row, column, or a diagonal. The first player to meet any of these requirements wins! If no one gets 4 in a row, column, or diagonal, then it is a tie. This program also allows you to play as many times as you would like. Have fun!
