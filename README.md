# 🎮 Connect 4 (Python-Based Game)
Welcome to my Python-based Connect 4 program!<br>
Feel free to play with a friend, and connect 4 in a row, vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.

## 🧠 How It Works
* The game runs in a terminal
* Two players take turns choosing a column (1-7) to place their token.
* The first player to get 4 in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins!
* If the board fills up with no winner, then it is a tie!

## ▶️ How To Play
1. Clone the repository in your terminal with the following command:
    * ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Noah-Arechiga/Connect-4-Game.git
2. Run the game in your terminal by typing the following:
    * ```bash
      python Connect_4_Game.py
3. Follow the instructions and have fun!

## 🎨 Features
* Simple and clean board design
* Input validation (no invalid or full column moves!)
* Option to play again after every game finishes
